## 9. Deployment & Compatibility

### Windows Support
When running the `apps/backend-ai` service on Windows (development or production), you **must** use the standard Python entry point guard to support `multiprocessing` spawn methods:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(...)
```

Failure to include this will result in infinite process spawning loops when `uvicorn` reloads or when worker processes start.
