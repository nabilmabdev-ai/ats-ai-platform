# Feature Spotlight: Intelligent Duplicate Management 🚀

**Say goodbye to cluttered lists and awkward double-emails.**
Our new Intelligent Duplicate Management system works silently in the background to ensure your candidate database remains clean, organized, and professional.

## 💎 Why This Matters

*   **One Candidate, One Profile:** No more digging through 3 different profiles for "John Smith" to find his latest resume.
*   **Professional Branding:** Eliminates the risk of two different recruiters contacting the same candidate for the same role.
*   **Accurate Reporting:** Your "Time-to-Hire" and "Pipeline Volume" metrics will finally be 100% accurate.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

### 1. 🛡️ The "Did You Mean?" Shield
*Stop duplicates before they happen.*
When you manually add a candidate, our system instantly checks for similar profiles (matching email, phone, or last name + phone). If we find a match, we'll gently nudge you: **"Did you mean to update John Doe instead?"** allowing you to merge data instantly.

### 2. 📥 Smart Bulk Import
*Import with confidence.*
Upload a CSV with 1,000 candidates without fear.
*   **Exact Matches:** We automatically update existing profiles with new data.
*   **Ambiguous Matches:** We flag them for your review, ensuring no data is overwritten by accident.
*   **New Candidates:** Created instantly.

### 3. 🩺 The CV Doctor
*Your database health check.*
The **CVthèque Doctor** is your dedicated dashboard for retroactive cleanup. It scans your entire history and groups potential duplicates side-by-side.
*   **One-Click Merge:** Combine two profiles into one "Master Profile" intelligently.
*   **Smart History:** We preserve all interview notes, emails, and applications from both profiles.
